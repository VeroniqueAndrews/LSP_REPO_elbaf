.... Boats sail on the rivers,
  And ships sail on the seas;
But clouds that sail across the sky
  Are prettier ? far than these.

There are bridges on the rivers,
  As pretty as 100 you 45 45 please;
But the bow that bridges heaven,
  And overtops the trees,
And builds a road from earth to sky,
  Is prettier far than these. 100
